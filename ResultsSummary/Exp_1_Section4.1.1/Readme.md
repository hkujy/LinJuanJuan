1. in the input folder, there is an excel file: checksol, contains all the enumeration 
2. In the cpp, there are three functions 
> ComputeBaressNetUnpm(alg);
     CompareBaressNet(alg);
	CheckScenario(alg);
3. Using these three functions, I can compute tthe rank, compare the two solutions and find the optimal solution from all the enumerated solutions
4. "print period .txt" contains the cost in each period
####  Plot
